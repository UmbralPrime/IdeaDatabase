# IdeaDatabase
This webapplication serves as a database interface for a better communication with companies.

In case you have questions about the code or if you have a problem you can contact me on: stef.pelkmans@gmail.com

The appsettings.json file can be found on the server the database is hosted on, you will need it so the application can have access to the database with the connectionstring.
